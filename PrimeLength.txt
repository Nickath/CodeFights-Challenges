/*
You are given a non-negative integer N, and your task is to find all the prime integers less than N. Write this numbers down as a string and return the length of the resulting string.

Example

For N = 13, the output should be
primeLength(13) = 6.

There are 5 primes less than N: 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11.
The combination string is 235711 which has the length of 6.
Thus, the final answer is 6.
