/*
You are given a string s that consists of English letters, punctuation marks, whitespace characters and brackets. It is guaranteed that the brackets in s form a regular bracket sequence.

Your task is to reverse the strings in each pair of matching parenthesis, starting from the innermost one.

Example

For string "s = a(bc)de" the output should be
reverseParentheses(s) = "acbde".
