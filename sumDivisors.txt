Given a non-negative integer n, your task is to calculate the sum of its non-prime divisors.

Example

For number = 8, the output should be
sumDivisors(number) = 13.

number's divisors are 1, 2, 4 and 8. 2 is a prime, so it shouldn't be added to the result. The answer is thus 1 + 4 + 8 = 13.
