/*
You are given a positive integer N, your task is to calculate the total number of primes less than or equal to N with additional requirement that each digit of those primes should be a prime number itself.

Example

For N = 11, the output should be
primeDigits(11) = 4.
There are 5 primes less than N or equal to it: 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. But there is a digit 1 (even two of them) in 11, and 1 is not a prime number. Thus, the answer is 4.
