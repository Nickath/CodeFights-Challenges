Given two strings s1 and s2, merge them into one string by overlapping the suffix of the first string and the prefix of the second string. If there's nothing to concatenate, return the concatenation of the strings.

Example

For s1 = "cesario" and s2 = "oputera", the output should be
singkatan(s1, s2) = "cesarioputera".

The strings overlap by the character 'o', making the answer "cesarioputera".
