/*
During the most recent social event you suddenly realized that you had forgotten your USB drive on one of the previous events. You are pretty sure that you had your flash drive with you just last week, which means that it was probably lost during one of the events of the last 7 days. So, you would like to find all the events you attended during this period.

The list of events you attended (including the most recent one) is stored in a table called Events. It has three columns:

id: unique id of the event;
name: the name of the event;
event_date: the date when the event has happened.
You want to come up with the list of all the events of the past 7 days that you attended except the very last one. Return it as a table with columns name and event_date sorted by event dates in descending order.

It is guaranteed that each day there is at most one event.

Example

For the following table Events

id	name	event_date
1	TGIF	2016-11-18
2	TGIF	2016-11-11
3	Weekly team meeting	2016-11-07
4	Weekly team meeting	2016-11-14
the output should be

name	event_date
Weekly team meeting	2016-11-14
TGIF	2016-11-11
